This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
path <- file.choose()

data <- read.csv(path)
```
```{r}
# Create polynomial terms
data$popularity_poly <- poly(data$popularity, degree = 2, raw = TRUE)
```
```{r}
# Perform the polynomial regression
model_poly <- lm(revenue ~ popularity_poly, data = data)
# Summarize the model
summary(model_poly)
```
```{r}
# Predict revenue based on the polynomial model
predicted_revenue_poly <- predict(model_poly, newdata = data)
# Create a data frame for plotting
plot_data_poly <- data.frame(
  popularity = data$popularity,
  actual_revenue = data$revenue,
  predicted_revenue_poly = predicted_revenue_poly
)
```
```{r}
# Load ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Create the plot
ggplot(plot_data_poly, aes(x = popularity)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = actual_revenue), color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +  # Actual data points
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_revenue_poly), color = "red", size = 1) +  # Predicted polynomial line
  labs(title = "Polynomial Regression: Revenue vs Popularity",
       x = "Popularity",
       y = "Revenue") +
  theme_minimal()

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
